 * A list view widget for displaying locations in the source code. Each record

 * QueryViewDriver), but is can also serve as a base class for any widget
 * which needs to refer to locations in the source code (@see
 * HistoryView).
 * The view has 4 columns, for showing the file path, function name, line
 * number and line text of a code location.
 * The widget owns a popup menu which allows users to copy information
 * from records, filter records, and more.
